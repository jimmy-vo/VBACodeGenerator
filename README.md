# CodeGenerator
## Description
I started this project around May 2017. At that time, I needed to manual code hundreds of byte handler for an ISO-TP communication. When you do the large amount of bit wise operations and byte array, you may easily make mistakes. So I decided to automate the software development process.

## Support
* *.c, *.h
* NvM management, multi-byte message, register
* typedef, include, define, block comment
